# What I'm doing right now

Last Updated: {{< timestamp >}}

Here I keep an up-to-date list of the things I'm focusing on and what I'm doing. Think of it as a more relevant and interesting "About" page. Inspired by [nownownow.com](https://nownownow.com/about).


## Getting fit

After a decade-long hiatus from weightlifting, I reignited my fitness journey in April 2024. I started with the Stronglifts 5x5 program to rebuild my foundation, and have since transitioned to Jeff Nippard's Essentials 4-times-per-week program. My goal is to surpass my previous fitness levels as I approach my 40s and be healthier than I ever was, but do it in a safe and sustainable way to avoid burnout and injury.

The journey so far has been both challenging and rewarding, rekindling my passion for fitness and turning it into a hobby I genuinely enjoy.

The most significant challenge for me has been managing my diet. My hearty appetite means I need to carefully balance my caloric intake. I'm learning to navigate the complex task of losing fat while gaining muscle.

Despite the challenges, I'm excited about the progress I'm making and the knowledge I'm gaining. This journey is not just about physical transformation, but also about setting a foundation for long-term health and vitality as I enter a new decade of life.

## Writing

I have always toyed with the idea of writing, mostly for myself but also with the hope that someone finds value in some of the things I write about. After much contemplation, I've finally decided to take the plunge. I'm committing myself to a modest yet meaningful goal: crafting at least one post every month. This rhythm feels sustainable and allows me the space to reflect, create, and polish each piece.

I've found Claude.ai to be a helpful companion in refining my writing and suggesting improvements. However, rest assured that each post remains authentically mine. I carefully infuse every piece with my personal voice, experiences, and perspectives.
